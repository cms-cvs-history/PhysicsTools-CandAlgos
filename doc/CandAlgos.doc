\section desc Description
Framework module for common particle candidate manupulation

\subsection interface Public interface
- candmodules::CandCombiner: combine pairs of candidates
- candmodules::CandReducer: clones a collection of candidates removing all daughters and external
components, leaving only kinematic information. This is ment to produce a "light" collection
of candiadates just containing kimenatics information for very fast analysis purpose.
- CandSelectorBase: base class for all candidate selectors. It is a specialization of the
generic selector module SelectorProducer.
- candmodules::CandSelector: selects candidates from a collection and saves their clones in 
a new collection. The selection can be specified by the user as a string.

\subsection modules Modules
None.

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
None.

\section status Status and planned development
